# angular-launch

Setting up a new [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) web app can be quite repetitive. Angular Launch aims to save setup time by offering a bootstrapped project with [npm](http://npmjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) baked-in and configured.

## Getting started

To get started, simply clone or download this repo and install the dependencies

#### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobysteward/angular-launch.git
cd angular-launch
```

#### Installing dependencies

```bash
$ npm install && bower install
```

## Troubleshooting

Do you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed?
